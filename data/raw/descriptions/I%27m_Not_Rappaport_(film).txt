I'm Not Rappaport is a 1996 American buddy comedy-drama film written and directed by Herb Gardner, starring Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis. Based on Gardner's play of the same name, the film focuses on two elderly New York City men – Nat Moyer, a cantankerous left-wing Jew, and Midge Carter, an African-American man – who spend their days sitting on a bench in Central Park, trying to mask the realities of aging, mainly through the tall tales that Nat spins.
