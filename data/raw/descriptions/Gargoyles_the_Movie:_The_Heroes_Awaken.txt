Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken is a 1995 animated fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. The film is actually the five-episode pilot ("Awakening") of the animated television series Gargoyles edited into one long feature film, being roughly 92 minutes in length. As a result, numerous scenes from the original broadcast episodes were cut due to time constraints. In addition, a number of scenes were also moved around and some dialogue was changed. The episodes were produced and aired in 1994, and the film was released to laserdisc and VHS in February 1995 and featured an interactive VHS/LD board game. The pilot episodes have been released to DVD as part of Gargoyles: Season 1.
