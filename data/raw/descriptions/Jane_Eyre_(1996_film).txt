Jane Eyre is a 1996 romantic drama film adaptation of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s 1847 novel Jane Eyre. This Hollywood version, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is similar to the original novel, although it compresses and eliminates most of the plot in the last quarter of the book to condense it into a two-hour film.
