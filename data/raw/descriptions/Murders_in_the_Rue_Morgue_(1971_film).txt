Murders in the Rue Morgue is a 1971 American mystery horror film directed by Gordon Hessler by American International Pictures (AIP). It stars Jason Robards, Christine Kaufmann, Herbert Lom, Adolfo Celi, Michael Dunn and Lilli Palmer. The screenplay by Christopher Wicking and Henry Slesar is a loose adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's 1841 short story of the same name. However, it departs from Poe's version in several significant aspects, at times more resembling Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera, and incorporating the historical character Eugène François Vidocq.
