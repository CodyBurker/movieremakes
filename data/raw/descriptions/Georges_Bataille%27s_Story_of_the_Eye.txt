Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye is a 2004 experimental film adaptation of the 1928 novel Story of the Eye by the French writer Georges Bataille. The film, directed by Andrew Repasky McElhinney, takes place in a seemingly abandoned house where a group of people engage in wordless acts of passion. The film covers a period from evening to morning, and the sexual couplings among the members of the house become increasingly harrowing as daylight arrives.
