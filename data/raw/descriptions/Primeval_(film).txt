Primeval is a 2007 American action-adventure horror film directed by Michael Katleman and starring Dominic Purcell, Orlando Jones, and Brooke Langton. Inspired partially by the true story of Gustave, a 20 ft (6.1 m), 2,000 pounds giant, man-eating Nile Crocodile in Burundi, the film centers on a team of American journalists who travel to Burundi to film and capture him.
