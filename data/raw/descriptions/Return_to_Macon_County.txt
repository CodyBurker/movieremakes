Return to Macon County is a 1975 American action drama film. Although written and directed by Richard Compton, who was responsible for the 1974 drive-in classic Macon County Line, and bearing a similar title, this film is not the latter film's sequel. It was re-released by Orion Pictures in the late-1990s.
