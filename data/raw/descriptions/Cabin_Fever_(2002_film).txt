Cabin Fever is a 2002 American horror comedy film co-written and directed by Eli Roth and starring Rider Strong, Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Cerina Vincent, Joey Kern, and Giuseppe Andrews. The story follows a group of college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods and fall victim to a flesh-eating disease. The inspiration for the film's story came from a real-life experience during a trip to Iceland when Roth developed a skin infection.
