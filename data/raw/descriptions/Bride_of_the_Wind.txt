Bride of the Wind is a 2001 period drama directed by Academy Awardâ€“nominee Bruce Beresford and written by first-time screenwriter Marilyn Levy. Loosely based on the life of Alma Mahler, Bride of the Wind recounts Alma's marriage to the composer Gustav Mahler and her romantic liaisons. The title of the film alludes to a painting by Oskar Kokoschka named Die Windsbraut, literally meaning The Bride of the Wind, though often translated as The Tempest. The artist dedicated this painting to Alma Mahler.
