Idlewild is a 2006 American musical drama film written and directed by Bryan Barber. The film stars Andr√© 3000 and Big Boi of the hip hop duo Outkast, and the film features musical numbers that were written, produced and chiefly performed by the group. Idlewild contrasts the group's hip-hop, funk, and soul sound against a story based on a juke joint in the fictional Depression-era town of Idlewild, Georgia in 1935.
