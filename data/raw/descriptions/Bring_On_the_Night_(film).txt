Bring On the Night is a 1985 documentary film directed by Michael Apted, focusing on the jazz-inspired project and band led by the British musician Sting during the early stages of his solo career and first solo tour. Some of the songs in the film appeared on his debut solo album The Dream of the Blue Turtles. Unusually for a documentary, Apted shot the film in 35Â mm, focusing primarily on band rehearsals, musician interactions, and interviews with every musician in the band. The film won the Grammy Award for "Best Music Video, Long Form" at the 1987 Grammy Awards.
