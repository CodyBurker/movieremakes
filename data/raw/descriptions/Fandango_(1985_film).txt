Fandango is a 1985 American comedy film directed by Kevin Reynolds. It was originally a student film titled Proof made by Reynolds while he was attending University of Southern California film school. It was a parody of Greek life at his alma mater, Baylor University. Due to his father's presidency at Baylor, though, he did not wish to portray the Baptist institution in an unfavorable light and gave it the alternative location as the University of Texas. The film is now a cult classic.
