Chairman of the Board is a 1998 American comedy film directed by Alex Zamm, and starring Carrot Top in his only lead role in a feature-length film. In the film, a surfer and inventor named Edison inherits and runs a billionaire's company. It was poorly received by both critics and audiences and was a box office bomb. Both Carrot Top and Raquel Welch received Golden Raspberry Award nominations for their roles in the film.
