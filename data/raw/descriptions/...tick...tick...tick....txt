Tick, Tick, Tick, stylized as ...tick...tick...tick..., is a 1970 American crime drama film directed by Ralph Nelson. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Racially provocative for its time, it stars Jim Brown in the role of an African American man elected as the sheriff of a rural county in the American South. It has become something of a cult classic for its cutting-edge portrayal of racial relations and its tense narrative.
