Gorp is a 1980 American comedy film starring Michael Lembeck and Dennis Quaid, and featuring early acting work of Rosanna Arquette and Fran Drescher in supporting roles. Directed by Joseph Ruben, with both story and screenplay by Jeffrey Konvitz and A. Martin Zweiback, the film follows in the tradition of the 1978 fraternity comedy National Lampoon's Animal House, and the 1979 summer camp comedy film Meatballs. Gorp was the penultimate film released by American International Pictures, before How to Beat the High Cost of Living two months later.
