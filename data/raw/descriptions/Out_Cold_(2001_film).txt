Out Cold is a 2001 American comedy film directed by the music video sibling directing team The Malloys. Starring Jason London, Willie Garson and Lee Majors, the film is about a group of snowboarders in Alaska. It presents itself as a parody of 1990s "ski school" films and makes a number of references to the film Casablanca. A number of elements of the latter, including plot and famous lines, were incorporated into the film.
