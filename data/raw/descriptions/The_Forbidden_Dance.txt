The Forbidden Dance is a 1990 drama film starring former Miss USA Laura Harring. Made to cash in on the Lambada dance craze by Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation, it opened on the same day as a similarly themed film, Lambada, produced by Golan's former company Cannon Films and his cousin, Yoram Globus.
