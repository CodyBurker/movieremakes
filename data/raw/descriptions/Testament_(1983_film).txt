Testament is a 1983 drama film directed by Lynne Littman and written by John Sacret Young, based on a three-page story titled "The Last Testament" by Carol Amen (1933â€“1987),. The film tells the story of how one small suburban town near the San Francisco Bay Area slowly falls apart after a nuclear war destroys outside civilization. It was one of the films, along with The Day After and Threads that portrayed life after a nuclear war, mostly in response to an increase in hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union.
