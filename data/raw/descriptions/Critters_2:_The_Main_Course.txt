Critters 2: The Main Course is a 1988 American science fiction comedy horror film directed by Mick Garris in his directorial debut, and the second installment in the Critters franchise. A direct sequel to Critters, the film was written by David Twohy and Garris, and stars Scott Grimes, Don Keith Opper and Terrence Mann reprising their roles. The plot takes place two years after the first film, as a batch of planted Critter eggs begin to hatch and resume their carnivorous appetite upon the town once again.
