Gumshoe is a 1971 British black comedy film that was the cinematic directorial debut of director Stephen Frears. Written by local author Neville Smith, who appears as Arthur, the film is set in Liverpool. Albert Finney plays the role of Eddie Ginley, a bingo-caller and occasional club comedian who dreams of being a private eye of the kind he knows from films and pulp novels. Having put an advertisement in a local newspaper as a birthday present to himself, Ginley is suddenly contacted for what appears to be an actual piece of detective work.
