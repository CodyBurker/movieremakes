The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film, written, directed and produced by Gerard Damiano, inspired by the 1944 play No Exit by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Starring Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems, it is widely regarded as a classic adult film, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969â€“1984). After his 1972 success with Deep Throat, Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania.
