The Invasion is a 2007 American science fiction horror film initially directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and written by David Kajganich, and starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Unhappy with the original edit, the production company hired The Wachowskis for additional writing and James McTeigue to re-shoot some scenes. The plot follows a psychiatrist (Kidman) in Washington, D.C. who finds those around her turning into emotionless beings shortly after a major Space Shuttle crash.
