Dracula Untold is a 2014 American action horror film directed by Gary Shore in his feature film debut and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. The plot creates an origin story for the title character, rather than using the storyline of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. In this adaptation, Dracula is the historical figure Vlad III "the Impaler" Dracula and transforms into his monstrous alter ego to protect his family from Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Mehmed II. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance cast in supporting roles. Principal photography began in Northern Ireland on August 5, 2013.
