The Biscuit Eater is a 1972 American drama film directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Earl Holliman, Pat Crowley, Lew Ayres, and Godfrey Cambridge. Based on a short story of the same name by James Street, it was released by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the last 'One Boy and his Animal' themed film made by Disney, as this subgenre eventually grew out of fashion. The 1972 film is a remake of a 1940 film starring Billy Lee as Lonnie.
