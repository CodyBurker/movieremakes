Yor, the Hunter from the Future is a 1983 science fiction fantasy film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Reb Brown, Corinne Cl√©ry, Luciano Pigozzi, and John Steiner. The film is an Italian-French-Turkish co-production based on the Argentinian comic Yor the Hunter, created by writer Eugenio Juan Zappietro and artist Juan Zanotto. Though the film was one of Margheriti's most financially successful films, it received mostly poor reviews at the time of its release and drew three nominations at the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1984.
