Yesterday's Hero is a 1979 British drama film directed by Neil Leifer and starring Ian McShane, Suzanne Somers, Adam Faith, Paul Nicholas and Cary Elwes. It also features Glynis Barber and Emma Samms in their early performances. The screenplay was written by novelist Jackie Collins, but was an original work and not based on one of her books. Although it has echoes of the life of the former player George Best, the film is not biographical.
