What's Up, Doc? is a 1972 American screwball comedy film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal. It was intended to pay homage to comedy films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, especially Bringing Up Baby and Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny cartoons. The film was loosely based on the 1971 novel A Glimpse of Tiger by Herman Raucher.
