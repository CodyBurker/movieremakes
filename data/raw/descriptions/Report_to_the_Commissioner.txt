Report to the Commissioner is a 1975 American crime drama film based on James Mills' 1972 novel. It involves a rookie cop in the New York City Police Department who is assigned a special missing person case, which in fact is meant to be a wild-goose chase to back up an undercover female police officer's role as the girlfriend of a drug dealer.
