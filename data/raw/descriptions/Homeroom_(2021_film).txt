Homeroom is a 2021 American documentary film directed and produced by Peter Nicks. The film, which is the final chapter of Nicks' Oakland trilogy, follows the lives of the Oakland High School class of 2020 as they try to make the most of their final year in high school amidst district budget cuts and ultimately the COVID-19 pandemic and the George Floyd protests. Ryan Coogler and Davis Guggenheim, the latter of whom made a similar film, Waiting for "Superman", were executive producers on this film.
