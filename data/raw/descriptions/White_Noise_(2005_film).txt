White Noise is a 2005 supernatural horror film directed by Geoffrey Sax and starring Michael Keaton and Deborah Kara Unger. The title refers to electronic voice phenomena (EVP), where anomalous voice-like sounds, which some believe to be from the "other side" â€” interpreted as spirit voices, are found on electronic audio recordings.
