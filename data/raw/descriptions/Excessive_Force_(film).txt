Excessive Force is a 1993 American action film. It was directed by Jon Hess, written, co-produced and starred by Thomas Ian Griffith and released by New Line Cinema. Despite being panned by critics and becoming a box office bomb, the film had a direct-to-video sequel, called Excessive Force II: Force on Force (1995), that bears no relation to this film and does not follow its storyline.
