Cherry Falls is a 2000 American slasher film directed by Geoffrey Wright, and starring Brittany Murphy, Jay Mohr, and Michael Biehn. The plot focuses on a small Virginia town where a serial killer is targeting teenaged virgins. After being submitted to and rejected by the MPAA numerous times, Cherry Falls was screened at several film festivals in some countries in early 2000, but did not have a theatrical release in the United States. Finally, it was purchased by USA Films, who telecast it on the USA Network on October 20, 2000.
