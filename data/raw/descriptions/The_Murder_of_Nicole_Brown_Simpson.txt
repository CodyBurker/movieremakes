The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson is a 2019 American crime thriller film directed by Daniel Farrands. The film is loosely based on the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, presenting a version of events in which Brown Simpson is murdered by serial killer Glen Edward Rogers, and not by O. J. Simpson, her ex-husband and the primary suspect in the case. Though Mena Suvari's performance as Nicole Brown was praised, the film was panned by critics.
