Lost Flight is a 1969 dramatic film written and produced for television based on producer Frank Price's unsuccessful 1966 TV pilot, Stranded, that instead had a theatrical release in the US and Australia from mid-1970 through 1971. The plot resembles that of later disaster genre films and approximates an adult version of Lord of the Flies.
