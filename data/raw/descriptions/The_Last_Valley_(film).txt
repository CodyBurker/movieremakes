The Last Valley is a 1971 film written and directed by James Clavell, an historical drama set during the Thirty Years' War (1618â€“1648). While war ravages southern Germany, a mercenary leader and a teacher stumble upon a valley untouched by the war. Based upon the novel The Last Valley (1959), by J. B. Pick, the cinematic version of The Last Valley was the final feature film photographed with the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process until it was revived to make the film Baraka in 1991.
