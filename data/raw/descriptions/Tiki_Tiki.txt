Tiki Tiki is a Canadian comedy film, directed by Gerald Potterton and released in 1971. Created by intercutting animated sequences with live-action footage from the Russian children's film Aybolit-66, the animated sequences tell the story of a group of monkeys who are working to produce a film, while the Aybolit-66 footage represents the film they are making. The film was inspired in part by Woody Allen's 1966 film What's Up, Tiger Lily?, which used original dialogue to recontextualize a foreign-language film.
