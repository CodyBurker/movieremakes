Downton Abbey is a 2019 historical drama film written by Julian Fellowes, series creator and writer of the television series of the same name, and directed by Michael Engler. The film was produced by Carnival Films and Perfect World Pictures and it continues the storyline from the series, with much of the original cast returning. The film, set in 1927, depicts a royal visit to the Crawley family's stately home in Yorkshire. As royal staff members descend on Downton, an assassin has also arrived and attempts to kill the monarch. The Crawleys and their servants are pitted against the royal entourage, including the queen's lady-in-waiting, who has fallen out with the Crawley family, especially the Dowager Countess, over an inheritance issue.
