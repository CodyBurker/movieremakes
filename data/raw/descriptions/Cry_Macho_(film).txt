Cry Macho is a 2021 American neo-Western drama film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood and written by Nick Schenk and N. Richard Nash, based on Nash's 1975 novel. Set in 1979, it stars Eastwood as a former rodeo star hired to reunite a young boy in Mexico with his father in the United States. There were many attempts to adapt Nash's novel into a film over the years. Arnold Schwarzenegger came on board to star in 2011, but canceled after a scandal. In 2020, Eastwood's adaptation was announced; he produced the film with Albert S. Ruddy, Tim Moore, and Jessica Meier.
