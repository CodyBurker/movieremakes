Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 is a 2001 religious science fiction-adventure film, directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith and starring Michael York, Michael Biehn, Diane Venora, R. Lee Ermey, Udo Kier and Franco Nero. It is a follow-up to the 1999 film The Omega Code, serving as part prequel and part alternate retelling of the first film. It has a significantly larger budget than its predecessor. Lead actor York detailed the making of the film in a journal which he then published in book form, titled Dispatches from Armageddon.
