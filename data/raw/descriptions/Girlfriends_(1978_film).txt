Girlfriends is a 1978 American comedy-drama film produced and directed by Claudia Weill and written by Vicki Polon. The film stars Melanie Mayron as Susan Weinblatt, a Jewish photographer who experiences loneliness once her roommate Anne moves out of their apartment in New York City. It was the first American independent film to be funded with grants, but private investors helped complete the film.
