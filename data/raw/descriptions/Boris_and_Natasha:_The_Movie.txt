Boris and Natasha: The Movie is a 1992 American comedy television film that was loosely based on the animated television series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Although Rocky and Bullwinkle do not appear in this film, they are referenced when two minor characters are revealed to be known also as "Agents Moose and Squirrel" during a climactic scene. This was due to the production company's inability to secure the rights to the animated characters' likenesses for this film. Originally intended for a theatrical release, this film was produced by Management Company Entertainment Group for Showtime Networks, and aired on Showtime on April 17, 1992.
