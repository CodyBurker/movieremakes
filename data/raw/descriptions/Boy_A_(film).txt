Boy A is a 2007 British drama film directed by John Crowley, from a screenplay by Mark O'Rowe, based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Jonathan Trigell. The film stars Andrew Garfield in his film debut as Jack Burridge, who is re-entering society under a new name in Manchester after having served 14 years in a juvenile prison; and Peter Mullan as Terry, Jack's caseworker. The novel is noted for similarities to the James Bulger case, whose offenders were released around the time of its publication.
