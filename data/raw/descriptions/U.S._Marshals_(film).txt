U.S. Marshals is a 1998 American action crime thriller film directed by Stuart Baird, with a script written by John Pogue. The film is a spin-off/standalone sequel to The Fugitive (1993), and is the second release from the franchise of the same name. Though the plot references the character, Dr. Richard Kimble does not appear; rather, it centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by Tommy Lee Jones. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by Wesley Snipes, who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, and LaTanya Richardson, several of whom portrayed deputy marshals in the previous film.
