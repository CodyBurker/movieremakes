Arthur 2: On the Rocks is a 1988 American romantic comedy film and the sequel to the 1981 film Arthur. Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli, John Gielgud, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Stephen Elliott, Thomas Barbour, Ted Ross and Barney Martin reprise their roles with Cynthia Sikes replacing Jill Eikenberry, who was committed to filming L.A. Law at the time, in the role of Susan Johnson. Burt Bacharach also returned to score the film. The soundtrack also features songs by popular artists, including OMD and Kylie Minogue. While still a comedy, On the Rocks is somewhat darker than its predecessor. The film received generally negative reviews and also was a financial disappointment when compared to the more successful original.
