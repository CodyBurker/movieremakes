Under the Cherry Moon is a 1986 romantic musical comedy-drama film starring Prince and marking his directorial debut. The film also stars former The Time member Jerome Benton, Steven Berkoff, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Francesca Annis. The film underperformed both critically and commercially at time of release, winning five Golden Raspberry Awards and tying with Howard the Duck for Worst Picture. However, the soundtrack album Parade sold over a million copies and achieved platinum status. Since Prince's death in 2016, several contemporary critics have also revisited the film and now consider it a cult classic.
