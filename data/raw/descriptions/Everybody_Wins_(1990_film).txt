Everybody Wins is a 1990 mystery thriller film directed by Karel Reisz, starring Debra Winger and Nick Nolte. The screenplay was written by Arthur Miller, based on his one-act play Some Kind of Love Story (1984). It is loosely inspired by an actual 1970s murder case in Canaan, Connecticut which was the subject of the television film A Death in Canaan (1978) directed by Tony Richardson. It was also the last film to be directed by Karel Reisz before his death in 2002.
