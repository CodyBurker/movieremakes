Rage is a 1972 American thriller/mystery film starring George C. Scott, Richard Basehart, Martin Sheen, and Barnard Hughes. Scott also directed the film, which is about a sheep rancher who is fatally exposed to a military lab's poison gas. The plot was inspired by a true event, the Dugway sheep incident, in which a jet accidentally sprayed VX, a lethal nerve gas, in Utah's Skull Valley resulting in the deaths of 3,000â€“6,000 sheep. Nicolas Beauvy is featured as the rancher's son in a cast that also includes Paul Stevens and Stephen Young.
