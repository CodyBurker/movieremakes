Pet Sematary: Bloodlines is a 2023 American supernatural horror film directed by Lindsey Anderson Beer, and co-written by Beer and Jeff Buhler. It serves as a prequel to Pet Sematary (2019), which in turn was based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Stephen King. It is the fourth installment of the Pet Sematary film series and stars Jackson White, Forrest Goodluck, Jack Mulhern, Henry Thomas, Natalie Alyn Lind, Isabella Star LaBlanc, Samantha Mathis, Pam Grier and David Duchovny.
