Memoirs of an Invisible Man is a 1992 American comedy-drama film directed by John Carpenter and starring Chevy Chase, Daryl Hannah, Sam Neill, Michael McKean and Stephen Tobolowsky. The film is loosely based on Memoirs of an Invisible Man, a 1987 novel by H.F. Saint. According to screenwriter William Goldman's book Which Lie Did I Tell?, the film was initially developed for director Ivan Reitman; however, this version never came to fruition, due to disagreements between Reitman and Chase. The film was a critical and commercial failure.
