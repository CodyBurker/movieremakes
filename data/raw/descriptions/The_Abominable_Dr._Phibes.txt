The Abominable Dr. Phibes is a 1971 British comedy horror film directed by Robert Fuest, written by James Whiton and William Goldstein, and starring Vincent Price and Joseph Cotten. Its art deco sets, dark humour, and performance by Price have made the film and its sequel Dr. Phibes Rises Again cult classics. The film also features Hugh Griffith and Terry-Thomas, with an uncredited Caroline Munro appearing as Phibes's wife.
