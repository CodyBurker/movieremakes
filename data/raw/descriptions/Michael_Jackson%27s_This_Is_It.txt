Michael Jackson's This Is It is a 2009 American documentary film about Michael Jackson's preparation for This Is it, a series of concerts that were cancelled due to his death in 2009. Named for the concert residency of the same name, the film includes additional behind the scenes footage, including dancer auditions and costume design. The film's director, Kenny Ortega, confirmed that none of the footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death, it was agreed that the film would be made. The footage was filmed in California at the Staples Center and The Forum.
