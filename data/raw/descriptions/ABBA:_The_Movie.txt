ABBA: The Movie is a 1977 mockumentary comedy-drama film about the Swedish pop group ABBA's Australian tour. An international co-production from Sweden and Australia, the film was directed by Lasse Hallstr√∂m, who helmed most of the band's videos. Its release coincided with ABBA: The Album, the group's fifth studio album, and features many songs from that album as well as many of their earlier hits, and one, "Get on the Carousel", unavailable anywhere else.
