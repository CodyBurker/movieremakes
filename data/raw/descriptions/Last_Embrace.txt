Last Embrace is a 1979 American neo-noir thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme. Very loosely based on the novel The 13th Man by Murray Teigh Bloom, it stars Roy Scheider and Janet Margolin, telling the story of a woman who takes a role similar to the biblical avenger Goel and kills the descendants of the Zwi Migdal, who enslaved her grandmother.
