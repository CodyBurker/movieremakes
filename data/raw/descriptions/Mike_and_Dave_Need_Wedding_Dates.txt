Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a 2016 American romantic comedy film directed by Jake Szymanski and written by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien. The film stars Zac Efron and Adam DeVine as the title characters, two brothers who put out an ad for dates to their sister's wedding, and features Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza as the girls who answer the ad. The film is based on an actual news event of a Craigslist ad placed by two brothers who wanted dates for their sisterâ€™s wedding that became popular in February 2013, which they then turned into a book, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates: And a Thousand Cocktails.
