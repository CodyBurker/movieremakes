It stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, and Larry Fishburn, with supporting roles done by Nia Long, Tyra Ferrell, Regina King, and Angela Bassett. Boyz n the Hood follows Tre Styles, who is sent to live with his father Furious Styles (Fishburne) in South Central Los Angeles, surrounded by the neighborhood's booming gang culture, where he reunites with his childhood friends.
