12th & Delaware is a 2010 American documentary film set in a crisis pregnancy center and an abortion clinic across the street from it in Fort Pierce, Florida. The film was produced and filmed by Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing and covers the center and its patients over the period of a year. The film shows interviews of staff at both facilities, as well as pregnant women who are going to them. 12th & Delaware premiered on January 24, 2010, at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Documentary Competition. It won a Peabody Award that same year "for its poignant portrait of women facing exceedingly difficult decisions at a literal intersection of opposing ideologies."
