Inherit the Wind is a 1999 American made-for-television film adaptation of the 1955 play of the same name which originally aired on Showtime on May 29, 1999. The original play was written as a parable which fictionalized the 1925 Scopes "Monkey" Trial as a means of discussing the 1950s McCarthy trials. It was George C. Scott's final film role. In the 1996 Broadway revival, he had played Drummond.
