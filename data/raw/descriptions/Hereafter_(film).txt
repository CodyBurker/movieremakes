Hereafter is a 2010 American drama film directed, co-produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood from a screenplay written by Peter Morgan. It tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar ways—all three have issues of communicating with the dead; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George Lonegan, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a clairvoyant, but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; Cécile de France plays French television journalist Marie Lelay, who survives a near-death experience during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and British schoolboy Marcus, who loses the person closest to him. Bryce Dallas Howard, Lyndsey Marshal, Jay Mohr and Thierry Neuvic have supporting roles.
