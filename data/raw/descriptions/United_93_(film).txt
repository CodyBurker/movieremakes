United 93 is a 2006 docudrama thriller film written and directed by Paul Greengrass. The film largely chronicles the events aboard United Airlines Flight 93, one of the four hijacked flights during the September 11 attacks and the only one not to hit its intended target due to the intervention of passengers and crew; it also covers the experiences of government officials and air traffic controllers watching the other events of the attacks unfold.
