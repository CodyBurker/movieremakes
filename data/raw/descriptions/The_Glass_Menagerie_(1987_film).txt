The Glass Menagerie is a 1987 American drama film directed by Paul Newman. It is a replication of a production of Tennessee Williams' 1944 play of the same title that originated at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and then transferred to the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. The film is the fourth adaptation of the Williams play, following a 1950 feature film and television movies made in 1966 and 1973. It was shown at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival before opening in New York City on October 23, 1987. It is also the last film directed by Newman before his death in 2008.
