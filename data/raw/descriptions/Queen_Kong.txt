Queen Kong is a 1976 British-German adventure comedy film parodying King Kong. The film was never released theatrically in the United Kingdom, due to legal action by Dino De Laurentiis, producer of the 1976 King Kong remake and RKO, the copyright holder of King Kong at the time. It got a limited release in Italy and Germany. The film has since resurfaced on DVD.
