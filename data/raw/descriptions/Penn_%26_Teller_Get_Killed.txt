Penn & Teller Get Killed is a 1989 black comedy film directed by Arthur Penn, starring the magicians Penn & Teller, who play themselves in a satirical account of what the audience would perhaps imagine them doing in their daily lives. Most of the action involves Penn and Teller playing practical jokes on each other and Penn's girlfriend, Carlotta. The final joke, as the title implies, has serious consequences for all three. It was the last theatrical film directed by Arthur Penn, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.
