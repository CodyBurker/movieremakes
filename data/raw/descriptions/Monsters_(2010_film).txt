Monsters is a 2010 British science-fiction horror film written and directed by Gareth Edwards. Edwards also served as the cinematographer, production designer, and a visual effects artist. The film takes place years after a NASA probe crashed in Mexico, which leads to the sudden appearance of giant tentacled monsters. It follows Andrew Kaulder, an American photojournalist tasked with escorting his employer's daughter Samantha Wynden back to the United States by crossing through Mexico's "Infected Zone", where the creatures reside.
