Pancho Villa is a 1972 Italian-Spanish spaghetti western film directed by Eugenio Mart√≠n. It takes as its starting point the life and legend of the Mexican bandit-revolutionary of that name, but has no other basis in historical fact. The film features Telly Savalas, Clint Walker, Chuck Connors and Anne Francis. Shot in Spain, this "brawling spectacle" has an often-overlooked light-comedy satirical facet, which to this day often confuses viewers. The storyline was developed during the Vietnam War and reflected certain antiwar sentiments in an American society. The title song "We All End Up the Same", with music by John Cacavas and lyrics by Don Black, is sung by Savalas.
