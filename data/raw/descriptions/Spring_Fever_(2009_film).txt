Spring Fever is a 2009 Chinese/French film directed by Lou Ye. The production of the film is in defiance of a five-year ban on filmmaking imposed by China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) for his previous film, Summer Palace. Filmed in Nanjing, the film was described to be about a young threesome overcome with erotic longings.
