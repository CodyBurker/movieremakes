Proud American is a 2008 biographical drama film released by Slowhand Cinema, in both conventional 35mm, and IMAX format. It features five stories that intend to capture the essence of the American spirit, two of them chronicling the founding of Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola. The film is the lowest-grossing wide release in movie history, and was noted for having obtained additional revenue through overt sponsorship of the two companies, as well as MasterCard and American Airlines, whose product placement can be observed throughout the film.
