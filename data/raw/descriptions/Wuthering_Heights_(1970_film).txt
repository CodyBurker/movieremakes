Wuthering Heights is a 1970 British drama film directed by Robert Fuest and starring Anna Calder-Marshall and Timothy Dalton. It is based on the classic 1847 Emily BrontÃ« novel of the same name. Like the 1939 version, it depicts only the first sixteen chapters, concluding with Catherine Earnshaw Linton's death, and omits the trials of her daughter, Hindley's son, and Heathcliff's son.
