The Trojan Women is a 1971 American-British-Greek war drama film directed by Michael Cacoyannis and starring Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave, Genevi√®ve Bujold and Irene Papas. The film was made with the minimum of changes to Edith Hamilton's translation of Euripides' original play, save for the omission of deities, as Cacoyannis said they were "hard to film and make realistic".
