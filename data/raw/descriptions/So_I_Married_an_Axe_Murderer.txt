So I Married an Axe Murderer is a 1993 American romantic black comedy film, directed by Thomas Schlamme and starring Mike Myers and Nancy Travis. Myers plays Charlie MacKenzie, a man afraid of commitment until he meets Harriet (Travis), who works at a butcher shop, and who may be a serial killer. Myers also plays Stuart, Charlie's father. The film received a mixed reception from critics and did not fare well at the box office, grossing $27 million, but it has gained a cult following in the years since its release.
