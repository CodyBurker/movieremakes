Mom and Dad Save the World is a 1992 American science fiction black comedy film directed by Greg Beeman. Jon Lovitz plays Emperor Tod Spengo, who is the cruel, inept, idiotic and over-dramatic emperor of the planet named Spengo. Teri Garr plays Marge Nelson and Jeffrey Jones plays Dick Nelson, her husband. The film also stars Eric Idle and Thalmus Rasulala. Rasulala died shortly after completing his scenes, and the film is dedicated to his memory.
