Squanto: A Warrior's Tale is a 1994 historical action adventure film written by Darlene Craviato and directed by Xavier Koller. Very loosely based on the actual historical Native American figure Squanto, and his life prior to and including the arrival of the Mayflower in 1620, the film stars Adam Beach.
