Hop is a 2011 American live-action/animated Easter fantasy comedy film produced by Relativity Media and Illumination Entertainment, and distributed by Universal Pictures. The film was directed by Tim Hill and produced by Chris Meledandri and Michele Imperato Stabile, from a screenplay written by Brian Lynch and the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, the latter two of whom also conceived the film's story. It stars James Marsden, Russell Brand, Kaley Cuoco, Hank Azaria, Gary Cole, Elizabeth Perkins, David Hasselhoff, Chelsea Handler, and Hugh Laurie, with Tiffany Espensen, Dustin Ybarra, and Hugh Hefner in supporting roles. The film follows a young rabbit who would rather drum in a band than succeed his father as the Easter Bunny, and befriends a human slacker seeking a job.
