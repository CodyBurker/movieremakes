The Second Civil War is a satirical black comedy television film directed by Joe Dante for the HBO cable television network, first aired on March 15, 1997. The film details the build-up to an ethnically-fueled civil war in an alternate future United States as a result of unsustainably excessive immigration, political self-interest, and ratings-pursuing news media.
