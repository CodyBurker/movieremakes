The Banger Sisters is a 2002 American comedy film written and directed by Bob Dolman, and produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film stars Goldie Hawn as Suzette and Susan Sarandon as Vinnie; two middle-aged women who were once best friends and groupies, reveling in 1960s/70s hedonism, before they lost touch and went their very separate ways. Suzette's decision to crash back into her former friend's current, and radically different, conventionally respectable life, is the basis for humor, with the clash of who they were and now are. The plot considers ageing and how people alter with time, whether incidentally - Suzette realizing she's now older than the current musicians - or deliberately, to try to find a place in the world, as Vinnie has, but sometimes losing part of themselves along the way.
