Child's Play 3 is a 1991 American slasher film and the third installment in the Child's Play film series. The film is written by Don Mancini and directed by Jack Bender. Brad Dourif once again reprised his role as Chucky from the previous films while new cast members include Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers. It was executive-produced by David Kirschner, who produced the first two Child's Play films. Although released only nine months after Child's Play 2, the story takes place eight years following the events of that film, and one month before the events of Bride of Chucky. The film follows a now 16 year old Andy Barclay enrolling at a military school. Chucky follows Andy to the school until he finds a younger kid, Tyler, to place his soul into, and now Andy has to prevent Chucky from harming Tyler and anybody else.
