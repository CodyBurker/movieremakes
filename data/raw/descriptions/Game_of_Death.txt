The Game of Death is an incomplete Hong Kong martial arts film, of which portions were filmed between September and October 1972, directed, written, produced by and starring Bruce Lee. The project was paused to film and produce Enter the Dragon. For The Game of Death, over 120 minutes of footage was shot, which was later misplaced in the Golden Harvest archives. The remaining footage has since been released with Lee's original Cantonese and English dialogue, with John Little dubbing Lee's Hai Tien character as part of the documentary titled Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey. Much of the footage that was shot is from what was to be the climax of the film.
