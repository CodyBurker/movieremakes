Let's Go to Prison is a 2006 American comedy film directed by Bob Odenkirk and starring Dax Shepard, Will Arnett, and Chi McBride. The film was loosely based on the non-fiction book, You Are Going to Prison by Jim Hogshire. It was released in theaters on November 17, 2006. The film was the product of creative interference on the part of the studio, according to Odenkirk, and went on to receive mostly negative reviews and was not financially successful.
