Stepfather III is a 1992 American horror film directed and written by Guy Magar. It stars Robert Wightman, Priscilla Barnes, David Tom, and Season Hubley. It is the second sequel to the 1987 film The Stepfather and a follow-up to the 1989 film Stepfather II. The film follows a serial killer seeking out another family to become a part of, using plastic surgery to disguise himself from the authorities. Unlike the previous two installments, Stepfather III was released made-for-television and Terry O'Quinn does not star in the title role.
