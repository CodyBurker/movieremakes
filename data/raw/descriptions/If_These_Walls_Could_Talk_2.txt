If These Walls Could Talk 2 is a 2000 television film in the United States, broadcast on HBO. It is a sequel to the 1996 HBO film If These Walls Could Talk, and like the earlier film is a female-centered anthology film, with three separate segments all set in the same house within three different decades in the 20th century. Unlike the earlier film, in which all the stories related to abortion, in this film all the storylines deal with lesbian couples.
